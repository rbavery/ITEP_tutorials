# Tutorial Recordings, Code, and Example Data for the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals
This repository contains materials from twice-monthly, live coding tutorials. Each tutorial lasts about 1 hour long and is broadcasted via Zoom. Invites and reminders for each call are distributed to members of ITEP, usually a week or a few days before each tutorial session.

### Following along with a tutorial on your own computer
Download or clone this repository by navigating to the upper right hand corner where it says "Clone or download". Make sure you have [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed. Then, in Rstudio, open the .rmd file for the workshop you'd like to run through (not all workshop recordings have corresponding .rmd files). Contact ravery@ucsb.edu if you have any questions.
