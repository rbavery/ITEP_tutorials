If you would like to make multiple reports with the same report format, talk to Barbara! You can call a R Markdown document from another R Script.

Also, she recommends using function output when creating text to re-use.

Here is a list.

1. This will be step 1
2. This is the next step.

```{r get_mean}
speed_avg <- mean(cars$speed)
```

```{r kable}
library(knitr)
kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```

If you want to accent something, you can make it **bold**. Or, you can use _italics_.

There are `r 2+1+3+4` sites in our report.
The average speed in the cars dataset is `r mean(cars$speed)`.

The average speed is `r speed_avg`.
```{r code_example}
3+3
```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
